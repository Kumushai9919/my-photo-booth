# 📸 My Vintage Photobooth 

I love visiting vintage photobooths🤎 to capture memories and take fun selfies — so I decided to build my own version!
This playful and nostalgic web app is built with React + TypeScript, allowing users to take or upload 3 photos, customize a photo strip with color themes, notes, and date stamps, and download the final strip. Perfect for creating and sharing retro-style memories.
